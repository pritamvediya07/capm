## Abstract

Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly interact, collaborate, and delegate tasks to one another autonomously with minimal human interaction. Industry guidelines for agentic system governance emphasize the need for users to maintain comprehensive control over their agents, mitigating potential damage from malicious agents. Several proposed agentic system designs address agent identity, authorization, and delegation, but remain purely theoretical, without concrete implementation and evaluation. Most importantly, they do not provide user-controlled agent management.

To address this gap, we propose SAGA, a scalable Security Architecture for Governing Agentic systems, that offers user oversight over their agents’ lifecycle. In our design, users register their agents with a central entity, the Provider, that maintains agents contact information, user-defined access control policies, and helps agents enforce these policies on inter-agent communication. We introduce a cryptographic mechanism for deriving access control tokens, that offers fine-grained control over an agent’s interaction with other agents, providing formal security guarantees. We evaluate SAGA on several agentic tasks, using agents in different geolocations, and multiple on-device and cloud LLMs, demonstrating minimal performance overhead with no impact on underlying task utility in a wide range of conditions. Our architecture enables secure and trustworthy deployment of autonomous agents, accelerating the responsible adoption of this technology in sensitive environments.

## Requirements

Install the `saga` package:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
Also make sure that `mongoDB` is installed (see [instructions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)) on the Provider side and the mongo server is up and running.

> [!WARNING]
> **Isolated MongoDB deployment required.** SAGA (and all of its branches including `main`, `a2a` and `anon`) assumes *exclusive* access to its MongoDB instance. Use a dedicated, containerized deployment. **DO NOT** share the DBMS cluster with other projects. Misconfiguration can result in **permanent, unrecoverable data loss**. We, the authors, bear no responsibility for data loss arising from improper setup.

## Setup

To set things up, we will first begin by starting a `CA` server, followed by a `Provider` server for our SAGA protocol.

**Before you begin**: if you wish to run SAGA's core components (CA, Provider) locally, you need to set all the IPs in the `config.yaml` to `127.0.0.1`. An example of a local configuration can be found in [`config_local.yaml`](config_local.yaml). You can omit any steps that involve updating IPs in the following steps.

#### 1. Setup a CA

Generate valid credentials and host the *.crt, *.key, and *pub files at some endpoint.

```bash
python generate_credentials.py ca saga/ca/
```

One way to host these files is to run a simple fileserver, such as a python HTTP server.

```bash
cd saga/ca/ && python -m http.server
```

Take note of the `endpoint` where this CA is hosted and update it under `config.yaml` for the `ca`. If running locally, omit this step.

#### 2. Setup the Provider

Host this provider service at some endpoint by running the following command. This will automatically generate Provider credentials and get them signed by the CA:

```bash
cd saga/provider/ && python provider.py
```

Take note of the `endpoint` and update `config.yaml` for the `provider`. If running locally, omit this step.

### Troubleshooting
Certificates can sometimes be tricky. If you are getting SSL errors (e.g., `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`), it's most likely a `config.yaml` error. 

Whenever you update the config file, it's **always good practice** to delete previously generated `.key`, `.pub` and `.crt` files. You can find such keys and certificates in `saga/ca` and `saga/provider`.

## User Registration

Central to all user operations within the SAGA ecosystem is the `user.py` script.  It supports both interactive and automated usage modes.

Interactive use for manual control and input:
```bash
cd user/ && python user.py --interactive
```

Automated for predefined operations using a user configuration file (e.g., for registration and agent setup)::
```bash
cd saga/user/ && python3 user.py --uconfig /path/to/saga/user_configs/bob.yaml --register --register-agents
```

Now for the purposes of demonstration, assume the user `Bob` wants to register a new agent under the name `customagent`, an email client agent responsible for handling Bob's inbox. 

In order to register `customagent`, `Bob` first needs to be registered with the provider using the `register` endpoint:

```
======= SAGA User Client CLI =======
1. Register
2. Login
3. Register Agent
4. Exit
Choose an option: 1
Enter email: bob@mail.com
Enter password: bob
11:25:44 [USER] Generating user cryptographic material...
11:25:44 [CRYPTO] Saving user keys to /path/to/saga/user/keys/bob@mail.com
[...]
```
> __Note__: all generated cryptographic material for the user will be placed within a `keys/` subdirectory. The user's public/private keys will be stored in the `<uid>.pub` and `<uid>.key` format.

## Agent Registration

Before registering a new agent, `Bob` needs to authenticate themselves with the provider:

```bash
======= SAGA User Client CLI =======
1. Register
2. Login
3. Register Agent
4. Exit
Choose an option: 2           
Enter email: bob@mail.com
Enter password: bob
11:28:35 [PROVIDER] User bob@mail.com logged in successfully.
```

After successful authentication, `Bob` can register `customagent` with providing all the required material (agent device and networking information, cryptographic content, etc.) for `customagent` to operate within the SAGA network.

```bash
======= SAGA User Client CLI =======
1. Register
2. Login
3. Register Agent
4. Exit
Choose an option: 3
Enter agent name: customagent
Enter device name: alpha
Enter IP address: 127.0.0.1
Enter port: 12345
Enter number of one-time access keys: 10
Enter contact rulebook: [{"pattern":"*", "budget":10}]
11:29:05 [PROVIDER] Agent customagent registered successfully with stamp DNRD50sR3PFHqXjiG7Xuyq2d5fzALKaKtY2MS/8PoE9S//+pcNpGlOeKXOB1tnI/YRs4IL0XI/HlKV243LmcAQ==.
```

> __Note__: Once an agent has been successfully registered with the provider, a new subdirectory within the `user` directory, e.g. `user/<aid>` or in our case `user/bob@mail.com:customagent`. This is `customagent`'s woring directory. This directory contains the agent's manifest: `agent.json` listing the required metadata for the new agent to be able to operate within the SAGA network:

```json
{
    "aid": "bob@mail.com:customagent",
    "device": "alpha",
    "IP": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 12345,
    "dev_info_sig": "Q78qQTDrrQRs77Kfe37IFQkU...",
    "agent_cert": "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDR...",
    "public_signing_key_sig": "mgVXMQo3zGLJD31700zkcdVlBmr...",
    "identity_key": "48qaThDW1vzO56sxzqh/WaphyO4BkuUa6V9Y+kHClUU=",
    "spk": "FLorcCb6WlYXqFFkHhBL55ErDp0ID4h0iXtNM1Kk2Es=",
    "spk_sig": "z4WU6gHCTE8RG3dgiBXD4UgzVV...",
    "opks": [
        "zogadPdg+j8lQNaXeiIo9rL1rPT33ykzBnFjsAx/Kzw=",
        ...
    ],
    ...
}
```

## Agent Communication

Once the new agent has been registered with the provider and its manifest has been created, the new SAGA agent can be run by simply creating a new saga `Agent` instance:

### Requirements

In order to instanciate a SAGA `Agent`, there are three things that are required:
- The agent working directory which contains the agent manifest `agent.json`.
- The agent metadata of the manifest (`agent.json`).
- A `AgentWrapper` instance which encapsulates a LLM Agent implementation e.g., a `smolagents` local agent.

### Kickstart Example

```python
from saga.agent import Agent, get_agent_material

# Gather required material
agent_workdir = "user/alice@mail.com:email_agent/"
agent_material = get_agent_material(agent_workdir)

# Create agent instance 
alice_email_agent = Agent(
    workdir=agent_workdir,
    material=agent_material,
    local_agent=<LLM_AGENT_WRAPPER>
)
# Goes online and can accept conversations from other agents
alice_email_agent.listen()
```

Once `listen` is invoked, the new agent goes online and other agents can start opening connections:

```python
from saga.agent import Agent, get_agent_material

# Gather required material
agent_workdir = "user/bob@mail.com:email_agent/"
agent_material = get_agent_material(agent_workdir)

# Create agent instance 
bob_email_agent = Agent(
    workdir=agent_workdir,
    material=agent_material,
    local_agent=<LLM_AGENT_WRAPPER>
)

# Attempts to start a new conversation with Alice's email agent.
bob_email_agent.connect("alice@mail.com:email_agent", "<QUERY>")
```

Users may use our implementation of a local LLM agent (available under `agent_backend`), but are free to implement their local agents using any library or manner as long as it inherits from the `LocalAgent` abstract class (defined under `local_agent.py`). The basic requirement is to implement the following function:

```python
def run(self, query: str,
            initiating_agent: bool,
            agent_instance: 'LocalAgent' = None,
            **kwargs) -> Tuple['LocalAgent', str]:
        """
        Run the local agent with the given query.

        Args:
            query (str): The query to run.
            initiating_agent (bool): Whether this is the agent that initiated the task or not.
            Can be helpful in using crafted prompts for the underlying model(s)
            agent_instance (LocalAgent, optional): An instance of LocalAgent to use.
            If provided, the agent class will not be reinitialized.
            We recommend not reusing agent classes, as most libraries attach minimal overhead to local agent wrappers, and reusing them can increase the attack surface for prompt injection and data leakage (as well as increase context window length).
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

        Returns:
            Tuple[LocalAgent, str]: A tuple containing the agent instance (a new one, if no agent instance was provided) and the result string.
        """
```



## Experiments

### Setup 

To get started, register the user using their configuration. We provide template user configs under `user_configs`. To register a user, run

```bash
cd saga/user
python user.py --register --uconfig ../../user_configs/emma.yaml
```

To register the agent(s) corresponding to this user, run

```bash
cd saga/user
python user.py --register-agents --uconfig ../../user_configs/emma.yaml
```

You can also register the user and agents in one go by providing both `--register` and `--register-agents` flags.

### Seed Data

Next, you can populate the "data" used by tools for each of the users by running:

```bash
cd experiments/
python seed_tool_data.py
```

This will use data from `experiments/data` to seed tool-related data for each user. Some of this seed data is based on the profiles used in the paper [Firewalls to Secure Dynamic LLM Agentic Networks](https://github.com/microsoft/Firewalled-Agentic-Networks), and is purely synthetic.

### Running tasks

The three tasks mentioned in the paper map to the following files under `experiments/`
- `schedule_meeting.py` : Scheduling agents coordinating to find a common time for a meeting and sending a calendar invite.
- `expense_report.py` : Email-reading agents coordinating to collect their expenses for a recent business trip, and one of them submits an expense report to HR.
- `create_blogpost.py` : Blogpost-writing agents use knowledge from prior blogposts of their users to collaborate and write a blogpost on some shared topic.

To run a task, first start the receiving agent on its endpoint:

```bash
cd experiments/
python <task.py> listen ../user_configs/config1.yaml
```

Then, start the initiating agent on its respective endpoint

```bash
cd experiments/
python <task.py> query ../user_configs/config2.yaml ../user_configs/config1.yaml
```

The agent corresponding to `config2.yaml` will then contact `config1.yaml` and they work towards their shared goal.

> __Note__: Make sure you set `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable before running experiments.


### Agents without SAGA

While this package is designed to mainly support SAGA, you can use our local LLM implementation without SAGA i.e., set up LLM agents and manage their communication your way. One way to do so is to run the two agents and exposing their endpoints via a Flask Request- hardcoding each other's endpoints and communicating via these endpoints.

```python
from agent_backend.base import get_agent

# Assume some user_config was loaded
agent_of_interest_index = 0 # Whichever agent (out of all user agents) you wish to run
agent_of_interest = config.agents[agent_of_interest_index]

# Initialize the agent
local_agent = get_agent(
    config,
    agent_of_interest.local_agent_config
)

# Assume query was sent by another agent

# Query the agent
code_agent_instance, response = local_agent.run(
    query,
    initiating_agent=False, # Set to true if your agent started the conversation
    agent_instance=None, # Replace with self object in subsequent interactions
)

#.....

# In subsequent interactions, use code_agent_instance as agent_instance to keep track
_, response = local_agent.run(
    query,
    initiating_agent=False,
    agent_instance=code_agent_instance
)
```
